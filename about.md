### The Long Way is a not-yet-begun blog by Caleb Bassett

My name is Caleb Bassett. I'm a husband, father, and Lutheran minister in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS). I serve a local congregation in Fallbrook, California and lead the technology subcommittee the [WELS Hymnal Project][1].

My interests include theology, philosophy, apologetics, technology, media, and the arts.
