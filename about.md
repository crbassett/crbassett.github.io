### The Long Way is a blog by Caleb Bassett.

My name is Caleb Bassett. I'm a husband, father, and Lutheran minister in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS). I serve a local congregation in Fallbrook, California and lead the technology subcommittee the [WELS Hymnal Project][1].

My interests include theology, philosophy, apologetics, technology, media, and the arts. My writing on this website will generally explore such themes.

My second daughter, Eva, has been undergoing treatment for leukemia since November 2016. I write [a journal of her journey][2].
