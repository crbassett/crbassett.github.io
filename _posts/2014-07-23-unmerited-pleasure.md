Today is the first full day of the WELS National Conference on Worship, Music, and the Arts. Yesterday included recitals and an opening Festival Concert. As I listened to the beautiful sound of a large choir, an impressive organ, and a full orchestra offering musical praise to the Lord, I remembered this passage from the book, “The Spirituality of the Cross” by Gene Edward Veith, Jr.:

> For me, enjoying a work of art—whether listening to music, reading a novel, or gaping at a painting—is an especially pure example of God’s sovereignty in human vocation. That I am able to take such unmerited pleasure through the God-given talents of other people who have a vocation that I by no means have myself always fills me with a sense of praise. Not just for the artist, but also for the God who is so wildly generous in all of his gifts.

“Unmerited pleasure” from God-given talents pairs well with the unmerited grace God has lavished on me.
