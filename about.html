<div class=“message”\>The Long Way is a blog by Caleb Bassett.</div>


<p>My name is Caleb Bassett. I'm a husband, father, and Lutheran minister in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS). I serve a local congregation in Fallbrook, California and lead the technology subcommittee the <a href="http://welshymnal.com">WELS Hymnal Project</a>.

<p>My interests include theology, philosophy, apologetics, technology, media, and the arts. My writing on this website will generally explore such themes.

<p>My second daughter, Eva, has been undergoing treatment for leukemia since November 2016. I write <a href="http://crbassett.wordpress.com">a journal of that part of our life</a>.
