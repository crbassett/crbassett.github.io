## theobibs

I am building out a collection of BibTeX files useful for pastors and theologians. The project is called `theobibs` and is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/crbassett/theobibs).

## WELS Hymnal Project

I am the chairman of the Technology Committee of the WELS Hymnal Project, a multi-year project to produce a new hymnal and accompanying resources for use in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.

## White Horse Inn

I have made a number of appearances as guest panelist on the *White Horse Inn* radio program. A [list of my appearances](https://www.whitehorseinn.org/host/caleb-bassett/) is available on the *White Horse Inn* website.

## Opus 54

In 2010 I produced a feature-length documentary film together with my friend Ian Welch on the topic of the mechanical action pipe organ in the chapel of Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary, Mequon, WI. The title of the film is *Opus 54*. The project's website is to be rebuilt.
